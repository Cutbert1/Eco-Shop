#### Bugs Resolved
|Bug|   Description |Solution Applied|Result|
|:------------|:----------------|:-------------|:------------|
|Basket, search and account duplication|After created mobile-top-header.html, on rendering when I try to reduce the size of screen the account, basket and search tends to duplicate when screen is reduced from 992px. ![duplicate](/static/images/readme_images/bugs/duplicate.jpg)|Added “d-lg-none" class to account basket and search|Bug fixed. ![duplicate-fix](/static/images/readme_images/bugs/duplicate-fix.jpg)|
|Webhook Handler|After making a purchase it shows successful on frontend, however there is internal server error 500 on /check/wh printed on python terminal. On stripe CLI it also shows 500 POST error. However stripe portal shows that payment intent is created and charge succeeds. ![webhook-handler1](/static/images/readme_images/bugs/webhook-handler1.jpg) ![webhook-handler2](/static/images/readme_images/bugs/webhook-handler2.jpg) ![payment-intent](/static/images/readme_images/bugs/payment-intent.jpg) ![log](/static/images/readme_images/bugs/log.jpg)|Followed below steps **1**. Get the payment intent from Stripe. **2**. Get the basket metadata. **3**. Get the billing and shipping details. **4**. Attempt to get the order object (if it exists), trying 5 times. **5**. If the order exists, verify the order in the database. **6**. If it doesn't exist (else), create the order in the database. **7**. When creating the order, included an exception catch to throw and 500 your Devtools > Network tab.|Bug fixed. ![webhook-handler-fix](/static/images/readme_images/bugs/webhook-handler-fix.jpg)|
|Checkout form|When checkout form is not properly completed and “complete order” is clicked, form throws up a toast error message which is expected, however the payment_entent.succeed goes through in stripe and confirmation email sent to user.|Added fields validation for checkout form, hence form does not submit unless all fields are validated. Therefore payment_intent.succeeded and confirmation email can only go through when form is properly completed. ![form-validation](/static/images/readme_images/bugs/form-field.jpg)|Bug fixed. Only payment_intent.created is ready at this time until form is properly completed before payment_intent.succeeded can go through|

## Deployment
### Local Deployment
|Steps|  Action |
|:------------|:----------------|
|PostgreSQL Database|Navigate to [PostgreSQL from Code Institute] (https://dbs.ci-dbs.net) and ender your email and submit. Database link will be sent to your email|
|Create a new Heroku app|Click new to crate a new app. [new-app](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/new-app.jpg) [new-app2](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/new-app2.jpg) Go to settings and open Config Vars and add config var DATABASE_URL, then copy PostgreSQL sent to your email. [settings](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/settings.jpg) [database-url](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/database%20url.jpg)|
|Connect  DB to local development web server|Install dj_database_url using pip command and update requirements.txt. In settings.py import dj_database_url [import-dj](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/import-dj.jpg). In settings.py in DATABASE section add below code [database](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/database.jpg) In the teminal run showmigration command to ensure you are connected to external database. Migrate database models to new database. Then load data starting with categories then products. Crease a new super user. Before pushing to GitHub delete external database from setting.py|
### Heroku Deployment
|Steps|  Action |
|:------------|:----------------|
|Hide SECRET_KEY|Generate a secret key and add to env.py using below code [secret-key](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/secret-key.jpg). Update secret key in setting.py [secret-key2](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/secret-key2.jpg). Import os to env.py. Import env at the top of settings.py|
|Ready project for deplyment|Update database session in setting.py to ensure development environment continues uding  local SQLite DB and can access external DB [update-code](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/update-code.jpg). Import env model into settings and update the code to check if the file exist in the environment before importing since env.py is not commited to GitHb hence Heroku cannot acces it. [import-env](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/import-env.jpg). Then create a Procfile [procfile](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/procfile.jpg). Inside Procfile add code to instruct Heroku to create web dyno and run guncorn to serve Eco shop app [procfile2](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/procfile2.jpg). Add runtime.txt to root directory and include python version [runtime](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/runtime.jpg). Return to Heroku and open the app you created and copy the link [heroku-eco](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/heroku-eco.jpg). Add ULR to ALLOWED_HOSTS in setting.py, ensure https:// is removed [allowed-host](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/allowed-host.jpg)|
|Install gunicorn| Use pip install gunicorn command to install and update|requirments.txt. Save and push changes to GitHub.
|Ready Heroku settings for deplyment|In Heroku navigate to app settings and open Config Vars. Create environment varaible DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC and give it value of 1 [collectstatic](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/collectstatic.jpg). Create a new varaible SECRET_KEY and set value to random key you must have generated [heroku-secret-key](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/heroku-secret-key.jpg)|
|Deploying Eco Shop App|Select Deploy on Heroku dashboard [deploy](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/deploy.jpg). Ensure Heroku App is linked to GitHub repository [connection](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/connection.jpg). Deploy barch to project [branch](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/branch.jpg). Watch the build and view activity tab on dashboard. After build click open app button to view the project|
|Setting DEBUG|In settings.py set DEBUG to True only if environment variable called DEVELOPMENT is present [debug](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/debug.jpg). Add new varaible in env.py DEVELOPMENT and set to 1 and push to GitHub[dev1](/static/images/readme_images/Deployment/dev1.jpg)|
